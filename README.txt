MaaS - Metal as a Service
*************************

MaaS lets you treat a group of physical servers as a cloud-like
resource to be allocated on demand. Each physical server (“node”) will
be commissioned automatically on first boot. During the commissioning
process administrators are able to configure hardware settings
manually before an automated smoke test and burn-in test are
done. Once commissioned, a node can be deployed on demand by name, or
allocated to a queue for dynamic allocation to services being deployed
on this MaaS.
