MAAS
****

MAAS is the successor to Orchestra. It offers a nice UI to provision your
Ubuntu servers. Each physical server (“node”) will
be commissioned automatically on first boot. During the commissioning
process administrators are able to configure hardware settings
manually before an automated smoke test and burn-in test are
done. Once commissioned, a node can be deployed on demand by name, or
allocated to a queue for dynamic allocation to services being deployed
on this MAAS.

For more information see `MAAS on Launchpad`_.
