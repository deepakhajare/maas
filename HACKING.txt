Hacking MaaS
************


Coding style
============

MaaS follows the `Launchpad Python Style Guide`_, except where it gets
Launchpad specific, and where it talks about `method naming`_. MaaS
instead adopts `PEP-8`_ naming in all cases, so method names should
usually use the ``lowercase_with_underscores`` form.

Prerequisites
=============
You will need to manually install Postgres 9.1 (postgresql-9.1 and
postgresql-dev), RabbitMQ (rabbitmq-server) and python-dev.

All other development dependencies are pulled automatically from `PyPI`_
when buildout runs.

Development MaaS server setup
=============================

Access to the database is configured in ``src/maas/development.py``.

The ``Makefile`` or the test suite sets up a development database
cluster inside your branch. It lives in the ``db`` directory, which
gets created on demand. You'll want to shut it down before deleting a
branch; see below.

First, set up the project. This fetches all the required dependencies
and sets up some useful commands in ``bin/``::

    $ make

Create the database cluster and initialize the development database::

    $ make syncdb

Run the development webserver::

    $ make run

Optionally, populate your database with the sample data::

    $ make sampledata

Point your browser to http://localhost:8000/

If you've populated your instance with the sample data, you can login as a
simple user using the test account (username: 'test', password: 'test') or the
admin account (username: 'admin', password: 'test').

To shut down the database cluster and clean up all other generated files in
your branch::

    $ make distclean


Adding new source files
=======================

When creating a new source file, a Python module or test for example,
always start with the appropriate template from the ``templates``
directory.


Documentation
=============

Use `reST`_ with the `convention for headings as used in the Python
documentation`_.

.. _reST: http://sphinx.pocoo.org/rest.html

.. _convention for headings as used in the Python documentation:
  http://sphinx.pocoo.org/rest.html#sections
