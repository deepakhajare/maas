Hacking MaaS
************


Coding style
============

MaaS follows the `Launchpad Python Style Guide`_, except where it gets
Launchpad specific, and where it talks about `method naming`_. MaaS
instead adopts `PEP-8`_ naming in all cases, so method names should
usually use the ``lowercase_with_underscores`` form.

Prerequisites
=============

You will need to manually install Postgres 9.1, RabbitMQ, python-dev and make::

    $ sudo apt-get install postgresql-9.1 rabbitmq-server python-dev make

Also, you might want to install Bazaar (bzr) to grab the source code directly
from Launchpad::

    $ sudo apt-get install bzr

This is the list of runtime dependencies that you'll need to install::

    $ sudo apt-get install python-django python-django-piston \
        python-django-south python-twisted python-txamqp python-amqplib \
        python-formencode python-oauth python-oops python-oops-datedir-repo \
        python-twisted python-oops-wsgi python-oops-twisted \
        python-psycopg2 python-yaml python-convoy

Additionally, you need to install the following python libraries
for development convenience::

    $ sudo apt-get install python-sphinx python-lxml

If you intend to run the test suite, you also need xvfb and firefox::

    $ sudo apt-get install xvfb firefox

All other development dependencies are pulled automatically from `PyPI`_
when buildout runs.

.. _PyPI:
  http://pypi.python.org/


First time using buildout?
==========================

Buildout is used to develop MaaS. Buildout, if configured so, can
cache downloaded files and built eggs. If you've not already done
something similar, the following snippet will massively improve build
times::

    [buildout]
    download-cache = /home/<your-user-name>/.buildout/cache
    eggs-directory = /home/<your-user-name>/.buildout/eggs

Put this in ``~/.buildout/default.cfg`` and create the ``cache``
directory::

    $ mkdir /home/<your-user-name>/.buildout/cache

The ``eggs`` directory will be created automatically.


Getting the latest version of the code
======================================

You can grab the code manually from Launchpad but Bazaar makes it easy to fetch
the last version of the code. Go into the directory where you want the code
to reside and run::

    $ bzr branch lp:maas maas && cd maas


Running tests
=============

To run the whole suite::

    $ make test

To run tests at a lower level of granularity::

    $ bin/test.maas maasserver.tests.test_api -v
    $ bin/test.pserv provisioningserver.tests.test_api -v

The test runner is `nose`_, so you can pass in options like
``--with-coverage`` and ``--nocapture`` (short option: ``-s``). The
latter is essential when using ``pdb`` so that stdout is not
adulterated.

.. _nose: http://readthedocs.org/docs/nose/en/latest/


Running tests with a real Cobbler
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once you have a Cobbler instance running somewhere there are some
tests that can be run against it::

    $ PSERV_TEST_COBBLER_URL=http://user:pass@localhost/cobbler_api \
        bin/test.pserv provisioningserver.tests.test_api

Adjust ``PSERV_TEST_COBBLER_URL`` as necessary. **Warning:** these
tests will modify your Cobbler database.


Development MaaS server setup
=============================

Access to the database is configured in ``src/maas/development.py``.

The ``Makefile`` or the test suite sets up a development database
cluster inside your branch. It lives in the ``db`` directory, which
gets created on demand. You'll want to shut it down before deleting a
branch; see below.

First, set up the project. This fetches all the required dependencies
and sets up some useful commands in ``bin/``::

    $ make

Create the database cluster and initialize the development database::

    $ make syncdb

Optionally, populate your database with the sample data::

    $ make sampledata

Install Cobbler, and import at least one distro and profile::

    $ sudo apt-get install apache2 cobbler
    $ sudo cobbler-ubuntu-import precise-i386  # For example.

Add yourself as a user in Cobbler. For convenience, give yourself the
password ``test``::

    $ sudo htdigest /etc/cobbler/users.digest Cobbler $USER

Alternatively, if you're not interested in the Provisioning Server or
Cobbler, set ``PSERV_URL`` to ``None`` in one of ``maas``'s settings
files (typically ``src/maas/demo.py``), and a fake Provisioning Server
will be used instead.

Run the development webserver::

    $ make run

Point your browser to http://localhost:8000/

If you've populated your instance with the sample data, you can login as a
simple user using the test account (username: 'test', password: 'test') or the
admin account (username: 'admin', password: 'test').

To shut down the database cluster and clean up all other generated files in
your branch::

    $ make distclean


Adding new dependencies
=======================

Since MaaS is distributed mainly as Ubuntu package, all runtime dependencies
should be packaged and we should develop with the packaged version if
possible. You'll need to add the dependency to the
``allowed-eggs-from-site-packages`` option in the ``buildout.cfg`` file. You
also need to add it to setup.py (And don't forget to add the version to
``versions.cfg`` as we run with ``allowed-picked-version`` set to false.)

If it is a development-only dependency (i.e. only needed for the test suite, or
for developers' convenience), simply running ``buildout`` like this will make
the necessary updates to ``versions.cfg``::

    $ ./bin/buildout -v buildout:allow-picked-versions=true


Adding new source files
=======================

When creating a new source file, a Python module or test for example,
always start with the appropriate template from the ``templates``
directory.


Documentation
=============

Use `reST`_ with the `convention for headings as used in the Python
documentation`_.
