MAAS Packaging Acceptance Testing
---------------------------------

The `test` make target will build binary packages for the current
branch using the latest packaging branch from Launchpad, and then run
the "test" script (from the current directory) in an ephemeral LXC
container.

Consider the "test" script, as it stands, as a bootstrap point for
further testing. It may not be suitable for full automated end-to-end
testing of MAAS, so be clear about what you need to test before
investing work here. OTOH, it is a good place to test that the
packages install and configure themselves as expected.
