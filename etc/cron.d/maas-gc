# Perform daily background cleanups in MAAS.
# 
# The "maas gc" command is for garbage-collection, such as deleting uploaded
# files from Juju's file storage API, and in the future commissioning logs,
# that have been superseded by newer ones.  (This isn't done immediately
# when the files are overwritten because (1) the transaction that overwrites
# them may fail, and (2) a file may still be in use when it's overwritten.)
