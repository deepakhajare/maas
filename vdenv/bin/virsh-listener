## * libvirt from the cobbler system:
##   after 'cobbler-setup' above is done, the cobbler system will know about
##   all the nodes and it will believe it can control them via the 'virsh'
##   power module.  It is configured
##   to talk to qemu+tcp://192.168.123.1:65001/system .  In order to allow
##   that to be valid we have to make libvirt listen on that port/interface.
##   This can be done moderately securely with 'socat'.  Below, we tell socat
##   to forward tcp connections on 192.168.123.1:65001 to the libvirt unix
##   socket .  It restricts connections to zimmer's IP address.

sock="/var/run/libvirt/libvirt-sock"

[ "${VIRSH_LISTENER_DEBUG:-0}" != "0" ] && cat <<EOF
Starting virsh listener.

You can verify this is working by powering a sytem on from the web-ui or
the following on the cobbler server:

zimmmer$ virsh -c qemu+tcp://192.168.123.1:65001/system
EOF

echo "Listening for libvirt requests on $sock."
exec socat -d -d \
     TCP4-LISTEN:65001,bind=192.168.123.1,range=192.168.123.2/32,fork \
     UNIX-CONNECT:$sock
