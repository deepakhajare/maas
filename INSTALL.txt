Installing MAAS
***************

There are two main ways to install MAAS:

 * as part of a fresh Ubuntu install using the Ubuntu Server installer
 * or from Ubuntu's archive on an existing Ubuntu install.
 
This is a guide to installing MAAS from the Ubuntu archive.

It assumes that you're working with:

 * a fresh Ubuntu 12.04 LTS install
 * a machine dedicated to running MAAS
 * control of the network your machine is connected to
 * internet access or a local mirror of the Ubuntu archive.

Installing MAAS from the archive
================================

Installing MAAS is straightforward. At the commandline, type::

  sudo apt-get install maas

From a fresh Ubuntu 12.04 LTS install, MAAS will pull down around 200 MB of packages.

Creating a superuser account
----------------------------

Once MAAS is installed, you'll need to create your first administrator account.

At the commandline, type::

  maas createsuperuser
  
Follow the prompts and MAAS will create an admin account that you can later use to log in.

Configuring a DHCP server
=========================

So that MAAS can PXE boot machines, you'll need a DHCP server. MAAS can work with your existing DHCP set-up but for this guide we'll use dnsmasq.
