Installing MAAS
***************
 
There are two main ways to install MAAS:

 * as part of a fresh Ubuntu install using the Ubuntu Server installer
 * or from Ubuntu's archive on an existing Ubuntu install.
 
This is a guide to installing MAAS from the Ubuntu archive.

It assumes that you're working with:

 * a fresh Ubuntu 12.04 LTS install
 * a machine dedicated to running MAAS
 * control of the network your machine is connected to
 * internet access or a local mirror of the Ubuntu archive.

Installing MAAS from the archive
================================

Installing MAAS is straightforward. At the commandline, type::

  sudo apt-get install maas

From a fresh Ubuntu 12.04 LTS install, MAAS will pull down around 200 MB of packages.

Creating a superuser account
----------------------------

Once MAAS is installed, you'll need to create your first administrator account.

At the commandline, type::

  maas createsuperuser
  
Follow the prompts and MAAS will create an admin account that you can later use to log in.

Configuring a DHCP server
=========================

So that MAAS can PXE boot machines, you'll need a DHCP server. MAAS can work 
with your existing DHCP set-up but for this guide we'll use dnsmasq.

dnsmasq should already be installed. However, if it is not, enter the 
following::

  sudo apt-get install dnsmasq

MAAS enlists nodes using a tool called Cobbler. Cobbler provides a 
configuration file for dnsmasq that you'll find here::

  /etc/cobbler/dnsmasq.template
  
Make the following changes:

 * ``domain``: if applicable, specify your network's domain.
 * ``dhcp-range``: specify the range from wluke haineshich dnsmasq should allocate IP 
                   addresses to servers in your MAAS.
 * ``dhcp-option=3,next_server``: replace **next_server** with the current 
                                  server's IP address.
 
Save that file and now edit the Cobbler settings file::

  /etc/cobbler/settings

You need to change two settings:

 * ``manage_dns``: change the 0 to 1
 * ``manage_dhcp``: again, change the 0 to 1.
 
Now restart dnsmasq::

  sudo /etc/init.d/dnsmasq restart


Import the Ubuntu images
========================

MAAS will check for and download new Ubuntu images once a week. However, 
you'll need to download them manually the first time::

  sudo maas-import-isos

Your MAAS is now ready for use. Visit the MAAS web interface in your browser
